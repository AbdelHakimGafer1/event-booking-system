## 🧠 About Me

```diff
+ I’m Abdel Hakim Gafer — a backend engineer passionate about clean architecture, concurrency, and scalable systems.
+ My core strength lies in using Go (Golang) to build fast, maintainable, and efficient APIs.
````

* I have hands-on experience using **Go** for production-level backend services and distributed systems.
* I specialize in **RESTful APIs**, **PostgreSQL**, and **middleware architecture**.
* I'm deeply invested in **AI-assisted development**, and I actively integrate tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot in my daily workflow.
* This project is my real-world demonstration of building systems that combine **human creativity + AI productivity**.

## 🎯 Project Goal

This is a complete **AI-powered full-stack Event Booking System**.
It allows users to discover, view, and book events, and offers admins a dedicated dashboard to manage events in real-time.

The goal is not just to build a CRUD app, but to showcase:

* ✅ Real backend experience
* ✅ Role-based access control
* ✅ Go proficiency
* ✅ Seamless AI integration
* ✅ Solid structure + clean codebase

## ⚙️ AI Integration

This project is fully developed using AI tools:

```diff
+ ChatGPT was used to generate base structure, fix bugs, write documentation, and optimize DB schemas.
+ GitHub Copilot helped speed up repetitive logic and React state management.
```

AI was **not a shortcut**, it was an **accelerator** — boosting productivity and helping me focus on architecture and logic.

## 🚀 Why Go (Golang)?

```go
// Go is my go-to language for backend development.
func WhyGo() string {
    return "Fast compilation, goroutines, simple syntax, built-in concurrency"
}
```

* Go provides **predictable performance**, **minimal memory overhead**, and **scalable APIs**.
* I love using Go for its **lightweight nature**, **zero dependency philosophy**, and **battle-tested HTTP frameworks**.
* In this project, the backend is optionally written in Go using `Gin` or `Fiber`, depending on the deployment branch.
